I want him/her to publicly denounce our President-Elect's racism and reassure the American people that Congress will not stand for policies that promote institutional racism. Specifically, I would like the Senator/Representative to condemn Trump's stance on stop-and-frisk immediately and repeatedly as we transition to Trump's presidency.</p>
